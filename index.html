            <p>The purpose of this project was to see how the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a data set on over 500 cities</p>
            <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any of the trends and correlations witnessed.</p>
